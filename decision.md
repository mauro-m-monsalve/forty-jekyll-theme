(A) Experimental Design: The experimental protocol encompassed a four-stage task to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making in non-human primates. During the initial stage, the primate maintained fixation on a centrally presented dot, sustaining this fixation throughout the subsequent two stages. In the second stage, two opposing targets were simultaneously presented on the screen. The temporal duration of the first two stages was manipulated by the experimenter, guided by the distribution over trials shown on top for each stage. Following this, a masked circle comprising randomly moving dots was introduced, with a proportion of dots exhibiting a specific degree of coherence by moving in a consistent direction towards one of the targets on the screen. During this stage, the primate engaged in a deliberative process, taking into account the presented evidence, culminating in the execution of a saccadic eye movement towards the target deemed to be the destination of the coherent dots. (B) Distribution over trials of the monkey's reaction times, the time it takes the monkey to make a decision based on integrating evidence at various coherence levels. (C) Proportion of trials where the monkey chose the target on the right. It measures the error rates in the monkey's choices depending on the dot motion strength. </p>
