  Figure 1. Unsupervised learning of hexagonal spatial patterns by a biologically inspired convolutional neural network. 
(A) Neural network representation of a sub-system in the hippocampal formation. The input layer encodes rich spatial information and is modelled after the activity of place fields in hippocampal subfield CA1. The output layer represents cells in Layer II of Entorhinal cortex, and is modelled as a recurrent neural network with random and sparse connectivity. (B) Feedforward weights W inherit a one-to-one correspondence with physical space (here a circular enclosure). Biological details suggest weights are learned in an unsupervised way via a convolutional kernel of Mexican-hat shape. (C) Hexagonal patterns appear as a result of learning the weights. The recurrent connections are mathematically proven to ensure the appearance of the patterns in enclosures of any shape. (D) Patterns in nature exhibit certain geometrical deformations and defects  (top row). The model naturally reproduces these deformations without any additional assumptions (bottom row).

Figure 2. Theoretical predictions are validated on neural recordings: Spike-time correlations are mostly symmetric, and their phases correlate with place field distance. 
(A) Heatmaps of the location of spiking activity of place cells for a rat exploring a square box 20 minutes (place fields). Each row shows the distance d between a pair of place fields (d from 0 to 1, 1 means infinitely far away). (B) Spike-time cross-correlations for cell-pairs in A (grey trace). The signal is filtered in the theta-band (8-12 Hz, blue trace). (C) At the population level, simultaneous recordings of hundreds of cells reveal that correlations exhibit a high degree of symmetry in the theta band (±120 ms). As a result, their phases at zero time-lag cluster at around 0° and 180°, and moreover, they correlate with place field distance forming two robust clusters in two-dimensional phase-distance space.
