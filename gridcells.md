  Figure 1. Unsupervised learning of hexagonal spatial patterns by a biologically inspired convolutional neural network. 
(A) Neural network representation of a sub-system in the hippocampal formation. The input layer encodes rich spatial information and is modelled after the activity of place fields in hippocampal subfield CA1. The output layer represents cells in Layer II of Entorhinal cortex, and is modelled as a recurrent neural network with random and sparse connectivity. (B) Feedforward weights W inherit a one-to-one correspondence with physical space (here a circular enclosure). Biological details suggest weights are learned in an unsupervised way via a convolutional kernel of Mexican-hat shape. (C) Hexagonal patterns appear as a result of learning the weights. The recurrent connections are mathematically proven to ensure the appearance of the patterns in enclosures of any shape. (D) Patterns in nature exhibit certain geometrical deformations and defects  (top row). The model naturally reproduces these deformations without any additional assumptions (bottom row).
